# Question Week3

Hello, I'm Zhilei Han and I am wondering:  
a) What's the logical system we have used so far to argue about FOL/PL?  
Say it's system B, another question is:  
2a) If B is FOL/PL, them how could it prove something about itself?  
2b) if B is not FOL/PL, then basically we are doing derivations in B to prove the properties. To validate the proof we need to eastablish the soundness of B which involves another system C. Thus my intuition is that there will be an infinite logical system chain. How do you explain this? Is this statement correct?

we will always rely on something to reason and we have to start at somewhere. Later we will see that a theory can talk about itself.
