# Question Week3

Hello, I'm Zhilei Han and I wonder:  
a) What's the system we have used so far to prove properties of FOL/PL?  
and:   
2a) If the system is FOL/PL, them how could it prove something about itself?  
2b) if it is not FOL/PL, then we rely on derivations in this system (say B) to prove the properties. To validate the proof we need to eastablish the soundness of B which involves another system C. Thus there will be an infinite logical system chain. How do you explain this? Is this statement correct?
