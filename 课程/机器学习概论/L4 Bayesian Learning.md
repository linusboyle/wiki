## Inductive Learning Hypothesis

Any hypothesis found to approximate the target function well over a sufficiently large set of training examples will also approximate the target function well over unobserved examples.

## Bayesian Learning

Bayes Theorem:

$$  
P(h|D) = \frac {P(D|h)P(h)}{P(D)}
$$

> P(D)可以用全概率公式计算。

可以避免P(D)的计算:
